      <h1>Felipe Serna Barbosa</h1>
      <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

      <p>I’m a software engineer interested in Machine Learning. One of my most recent projects is called the <a href="https://github.com/felipeserna/AirBnB_clone">AirBnB Clone</a> which<br>
         was an approach to a simple clone of the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB website</a>. With the help of other peers, I built a back-end with Python,<br>
         MySQL, and Flask, and a front-end with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The technologies I’m most fluent in are Tensorflow,<br>
         Keras, and Numpy from Python.
      </p>
         
      <p>My background is in Chemical Engineering. I graduated from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia. In my Chemical Engineering<br>
         thesis I designed and built the first microreactor in Colombia for manufacturing biodiesel. Chemical processes are optimized<br>
         with the help of programming and simulations.
      </p>
         
      <p>What motivates me is an unstoppable desire to learn new things everyday to improve human and animal lives in some way.<br>
         I’m convinced that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) is the base for improving things such as food and<br>
         medicine, without harming the environment. I can impact a team with positive energy, new ideas, and helping my coworkers.
