<p>I’m a software engineer interested in Machine Learning. One of my most recent projects is called the AirBnB Clone which<br>
   was an approach to a simple clone of the AirBnB website. With the help of other peers, I built a back-end with Python,<br>
   MySQL, and Flask, and a front-end with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The technologies I’m most fluent in are Tensorflow,<br>
   Keras, and Numpy from Python.</p>
   
<p>My background is in Chemical Engineering. I graduated from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia with a 4.0 / 5.0 GPA.<br>
   In my Chemical Engineering thesis I designed and built the first microreactor in Colombia for manufacturing biodiesel.<br>
   Chemical processes are optimized with the help of programming languages and simulations, so I realized that I had to<br>
   improve my coding skills, and I realized that in Holberton I did not have to pay until I found a job.</p>
   
<p>What motivates me is an unstoppable desire to learn new things everyday to improve human and animal lives in some way.<br>
   I’m convinced that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) is the base for improving things such as food and<br>
   medicine, without harming the environment. I can impact a team with positive energy, new ideas, and helping my coworkers.</p>
