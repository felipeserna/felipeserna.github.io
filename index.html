<p>I’m a software engineer interested in Machine Learning. One of my most recent projects is called the <a href="https://github.com/felipeserna/AirBnB_clone">AirBnB Clone</a> which<br>
   was an approach to a simple clone of the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB website</a>. With the help of other peers, I built a back-end with Python,<br>
   MySQL, and Flask, and a front-end with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The technologies I’m most fluent in are Tensorflow,<br>
   Keras, and Numpy from Python.</p>
   
<p>My background is in Chemical Engineering. I graduated from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia. In my Chemical Engineering<br>
   thesis I designed and built the first microreactor in Colombia for manufacturing biodiesel. Chemical processes are optimized<br>
   with the help of programming and simulations.</p>
   
<p>What motivates me is an unstoppable desire to learn new things everyday to improve human and animal lives in some way.<br>
   I’m convinced that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) is the base for improving things such as food and<br>
   medicine, without harming the environment. I can impact a team with positive energy, new ideas, and helping my coworkers.</p>
