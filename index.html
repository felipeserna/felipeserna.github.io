<p>I’m a software engineer interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. One of my most recent projects is called the AirBnB Clone which
   was an approach to a simple clone of the AirBnB website. With the help of other peers, I built a back-end with Python, MySQL, and Flask,
   and a front-end with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The technologies I’m most fluent in are Tensorflow, Keras, and Numpy from Python.
   My background is in Chemical Engineering. I graduated from Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia with a 4.0 / 5.0 GPA.
   In my Chemical Engineering thesis I designed and built the first microreactor in Colombia for manufacturing biodiesel.
   Chemical processes are optimized with the help of programming languages and simulations, so I realized that I had to improve my coding skills,
   and I realized that in Holberton I did not have to pay until I found a job. What motivates me is an unstoppable desire to learn new things
   everyday to improve human and animal lives in some way. I’m convinced that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) is the
   base for improving things such as food and medicine, without harming the environment. I can impact a team with positive energy,
   new ideas, and helping my coworkers.</p>
